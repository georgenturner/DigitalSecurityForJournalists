An ongoing issue in the privacy and security of digital communications
is the increasingly revealing nature of metadata and the sheer volume of
data that is observable by third
parties,<sup>[57](footnotes/README.html)</sup> especially as
location-aware mobile and embedded technologies become more prevalent.
Beyond our duty to investigate, report on, and explain the implications
of these issues, the journalism industry should evaluate its
relationship to efforts like [Digital Due
Process](http://www.digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=DF652CE0-2552-11DF-B455000C296BA163).
In our own work, we must continue to be rigorous in protecting the
privacy of our sources and readers, not just in reporting but [in
publication](http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/susan_mcgregor_on_gun_permit_d.php).
