The legal and tehnical infrastructure of today’s digital communication
systems has enormous implications for journalistic source protection,
and keeping our industry on stable footing given the ever-shifting
ground at the intersection of these two fields will require significant
education, organization and innovation from the journalistic profession
as whole.

The recommendations presented here can neither be outsourced nor
implemented overnight. But by pursuing the education of our colleagues,
the coordination of our institutions, and collabortion with the digital
security field, we can provide better protection to our sources and
ourselves. Only by doing this can we protect our ability to hold power
accountable, serve the public, and honor in practice the spirit of
existing shield protections.

Perhaps even more than this, the journalism industry can help support
those working for the freedom of the press all over the world by using
and innovating around secure, usable digital communication tools. Only
through long-term partnerships and/or the support of a recognized market
can truly sustainable solutions be developed; journalistic organizations
can and should be that market, for their own sake as well as the
public’s. The collective force and voice of our industry can help spur
not only the technical but the legal changes that will help all users
recapture their fundamental rights to privacy, freedom of association,
and freedom of expression. If we are not willing to vigorously and
emphatically fight for these rights, we may soon find that we no longer
recognize ourselves as either a profession, or a nation.
