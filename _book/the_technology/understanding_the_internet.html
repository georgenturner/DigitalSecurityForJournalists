                        <h2 id="understanding-the-internet">Understanding the Internet</h2>
<p>The vulnerabilities that your data faces in terms of observation,
collection, and manipulation–both legal and illegal–stem directly from
some of the essential features of the system described above. In order
to function, the network of nodes and links that comprise the Internet
requires certain information (target and return addresses, for example)
to be attached to every data packet it sends. Moreover, the distributed
nature of the system means that this information is seen by a large
number of nodes and the parties that operate them.</p>
<p>Yet while we have little control over the exposure of metadata like the
“to” and “from” addresses of our emails, choosing the right connection
methods and using the right tools appropriately can reduce the general
observability of our data as it traverses the Internet. By coupling an
understanding of how digital communication systems work with the
capacities of secure-communications tools, we can develop and adapt
effective strategies for improving the privacy of our communications
with sources and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-the-web">Getting to the Web</h3>
<p>In the first incarnation of the commercial Web, the number of hands that
touched your data on its way to and from the Internet was especially
apparent. Accessing the Internet required that you wire your computer to
a physical modem which was itself plugged into a telephone line and had
it call a dedicated Internet service provider (ISP) when you wanted to
connect. Because users typically paid by the minute and Web indices like
Yahoo and Google did not yet exist, ISPs like America Online (AOL) often
leveraged their gatekeeper status, funneling users through a proprietary
landing page, with the broader Web only accessible beyond its threshold.
In this configuration, the parties who could “see” our online activity
were fairly apparent: the telephone company that received the call, and
the ISP whose portal we used to send and receive data from the Web.</p>
<p>Though most of the visible signposts have since disappeared, our digital
information passes through the same sets of hands today. In most cases,
in fact, only two things have changed. In 2014, our telecom provider and
Internet service provider will likely be one and the same, and our
actual access to the Web–whether on a computer, phone, or tablet– is
probably wireless. While undoubtedly convenient, these changes also mean
that today the records of our online activities are concentrated in
fewer and fewer hands, and as we walk around with our devices, the
default configuration of our digital “return addresses” provides a more
and more minute trace of our physical movements.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-get-physical">Let’s Get Physical</h3>
<p>Computers, mobile phones, and tablets are our tangible interfaces to the
networked digital world. At some point, as they send and receive
information over the Web, all of those virtual messages have to find
their way back to the correct physical device so that we can access that
email or load that news story. In the case of wireless routers, any
number of devices may be connected to the same data “pipe.” In order to
correctly send and return all those little data packets that make up a
Web page or even a Tweet, a wireless router must be able to uniquely
identify each individual device. To make this possible, every
Internet-enabled device on earth is assigned a unique machine address
code (MAC) at the time of manufacture. By combining pieces of this ID
with pieces of its own address, wireless routers are able to accurately
exchange information with the Web on behalf of dozens of devices at a
time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MAC address is a set of six semicolon-separated letter/number
pairs: the first three sets comprise the “vendor id” indicating the
device manufacturer, such Apple or Sony. The second three sets are the
“device” ID.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="getting-connected">Getting Connected</h3>
<p>When a computer or wireless device is looking for a connection, it
essentially does so by shouting its MAC out to the world and waiting for
a router to respond, like a digital version of the kids’ game “Marco
Polo.” The wireless router then uses the latter half of that MAC to
create a temporary ID for your device, which it will store along with a
variation on the Internet protocol (IP) address that the router itself
has been assigned by your ISP. While the former is used to send
information from the router back to your device, the latter is used as
the “return address” for the information your device sends out to the
Web. Because each of these is created anew every time your device
connects to the router, your device’s “return address” will change
slightly each time you connect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a well-managed system your device’s MAC should never move past the
router. A malicious party operating the router, however, can capture
this information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, though IP addresses are designed to describe the geography of
the digital world, they have a direct mapping to the physical world as
well. This is not an accident; the opportunistic routing of the Internet
only works if a node can tell which of its neighbors is the closest to
the final destination marked on the particular packet. This is the layer
at which digital and physical location correlate: For the ISP, a, IP
address can be mapped, not just to a general geographic vicinity, but
all the way down an individual router.</p>
<p>This illustrates just one of the ways in which our digital activities
can be mapped to our physical identities: Not only does our ISP know the
precise location of individual routers, it knows who pays the bills for
them, including name, address, and credit card or other financial
information. Since all of these are available for subpoena under the
ECPA rules mentioned above, it is easy to see how Web browsing–more so
from the home–is almost never substantively “private,” especially from
law enforcement or other government entities.</p>
<p>In point of fact, the wireless router in your home (if you use one) is
not the only router through which your Web traffic is likely to pass.
Almost all major ISPs have even larger routers that they use to route
traffic from their customers in a particular geographic area out to the
broader Web. Typically it is actually this latter, more general IP
address that is visible to the broader Internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can view your own current IP address by visiting: <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank">What’s my
IP?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="your-data-s-identity">Your Data’s Identity</h3>
<p>In the course of a day, most of us connect to the Web from at least
several wireless access points–even more when we consider our mobile
devices. Unfortunately, the “return address” IP information our data
packets carry with them is by no means the only, or even the most
granular, data that our Web activities carry with them. A great deal of
information is stored in the software we use to actually access the Web:
namely, Web browsers and apps. For example, most browsers share
information about your operating system and browser type with websites,
primarily so that they can provide you with the best user experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most websites can see - and log - the time, your browser type, and
your location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Added to this, Web “cookies” - small bits of text stored on your hard
drive via your browser - can be used to track your Web activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://live.wsj.com/video/how-advertisers-use-Internet-cookies-to-track-you/92E525EB-9E4A-4399-817D-8C4E6EF68F93.html" target="_blank">“How cookies track
you”</a>
for more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Though cookies set by one website cannot be detected or read by
another, companies like Google can set cookies on so many sites that
even their cookies alone can uniquely identify a
user;<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">31</a></sup> programs that can access
browsing history can do this as
well.<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">32</a></sup> This browser “fingerprint”
can be used to draw together otherwise disparate threads of Web
activity, and revealing your own identity and potentially that of a
source.</p>
<p>Thus, every time we request a Web page, we are not only locating
ourselves to our service provider, but fingerprinting and timestamping
our traffic across locations, like thousands of pieces of digital
registered mail. Moreover, even if the resolution of our “return
address” is not particularly granular to the outside Web, there are
other ways that our digital “fingerprint” can be connected to our
physical identity. This is exactly what we do when we log in to a Web
service, be it Facebook, or Gmail, or Twitter, or Amazon.com. To these
providers–or anyone who is eavesdropping on their communications or who
has access to their logs–the browser fingerprint, digital-geographic
“return address” and physical identity of Web activity is not only
timestamped and transparent, but highly detailed and often verified,
through billing or other personal information.</p>
<p>Though our device’s exact “return address” on a network will change
slightly each time one reconnects, browser fingerprints tend to change
little over the course of weeks or even months. Once linked to your real
identity, it can be used fairly effectively to track your activity on
the Web across swathes of time and space.</p>
<p>The above applies regardless of which type of wireless device one uses
to connect to the Internet: Laptops, tablets, and Internet-enabled
mobile phones all employ these same mechanisms. Of course, given the
constant signal hand-off among cell-towers required in order for you to
walk down the street with a mobile device and carry on a phone
conversation, load a Webpage, or provide required emergency services
access, your service provider can physically pinpoint your phone to
within 50 to 300 meters at any given
time.<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">33</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="what-about-the-bad-guys-">What About the “Bad” Guys?</h3>
<p>Until this point, we have been considering data collection, retention,
and access that fall within the current business and legal norms of the
United States. Whether these meet our personal preferences or
professional requirements, they represent the default operating
environment for digital communications when, in effect, all parties are
following the rules.</p>
<p>But there are other players on the system as well. Hackers, identity
thieves and hostile observers may also wish to track our behavior,
identify us, and access or manipulate our accounts. Though we cannot
control <em>what</em> metadata will be sent along with our information requests
over the Web, we do have some choices about <em>how</em> it is sent. Making
these choices wisely can have an enormous impact on the relative
visibility of our Web activity to unauthorized observers.</p>
<h3 id="nothing-but-noise">Nothing But Noise</h3>
<p>Whether bridging the physical gap between your device and a wireless
router or sending data across the network to and from a website, there
are two broad classes of connections available in each case: unsecured
and secured. In an unsecured connection, information sent between the
two points is transmitted in “clear” or “plain” text–as readable as this
sentence to any party watching. With a secured connection, at least some
level of encryption–essentially scrambling of the message–is applied
before information is sent over the network, drastically reducing the
ability of outside observers to infer what’s being sent. As we will see
below, these situations are analogous to sending and receiving postcards
and letters (in envelopes), respectively.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the information that an observer can see depends upon
his or her position in the network. If you connect to an unsecured
wireless network, your Web activity (what pages you are visiting and so
on) is potentially observable by any other device on that same network</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, see Julian Oliver’s <a href="http://julianoliver.com/output/log_2014-04-23_21-12" target="_blank">“Reconstructing images from Web
traffic”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>. If you connect to an unsecured website, the information you are
sending back and forth to that website is potentially observable by
anyone with access to one of the nodes on the network that passes it
along. At a given moment, this would include anyone with access to the
router you’re connected to and the Internet service provider that links
that router to the wider Web. Though questionable, “sniffing” packets on
the broader Web is more than
possible.<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">34</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="wireless-level-security">Wireless-level Security</h3>
<p>In practice, using an unsecured wireless network is somewhat analogous
to shouting your order across a crowded restaurant rather than waiting
for someone to come and take your order at your table. What you’re
sending and receiving can be heard by anyone in the room who chooses to
listen: Your device is speaking in a language that anyone can
understand.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/websecurity002a.jpg" alt="An unsecured wireless connection means other devices can easily
“overhear” the data your device sends and
receives.">
An unsecured wireless connection means other devices can easily
“overhear” the data your device sends and receives.</p>
<p>In a secure connection, however, communication begins with a kind of
one-to-one greeting process. Your device identifies the router and sends
it a short message, indicating that you would like to connect. The
router then replies to your message with a randomly generated nonsense
string that both devices will use as the basis for a kind of elaborate
Pig Latin in which all of your messages will be exchanged from that
point on. Thus, while your device is still sending all its messages
across the room, those messages are protected in such a way that only
your device and the router can “hear” what is being sent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“WPA2 enterprise” security is most robust; though “WPA2 home” <a href="https://github.com/susanemcg/DigitalSecurityForJournalists/issues/5" target="_blank">has
some
vulnerabilities</a>,
both are far preferable to an unsecured network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="graphics/websecurity002b.jpg" alt="In a secure connection, the messages that devices exchange with the
router are protected.">

<h3 id="small-s-big-significance">Small <em>s</em>, Big Significance</h3>
<p>When it comes to connecting to a website, one also has the choice
between a secure and an insecure connection. At any given moment you can
tell which type of connection you are using simply by looking at the url
bar of your browser window–the location will start with either <em>http</em> or
<em>https</em>. The significant difference between these two lies in the little
<em>s</em> at the end of the second; it stands for “secure.”</p>
<p>What does it mean for your connection to a website to be secure? In
effect, it is much the same as in the case of the wireless connection
described above: A secured connection means that the information you are
sending back and forth to that website is encoded in such a way that
your messages look like gibberish to anyone observing.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is an important difference between communicating
with a router that is in the same room as you are (or very nearby) and
communicating with a website that may be on the other side of the world.
In a coffee shop or library, there is almost always a third party–a
person, maybe a sign–that provides the name of the network you should
connect to, and (if it is secure) its password. Though most of us assume
this information is correct if we’re able to successfully connect to the
Internet, our decision to use that network also implies a good deal of
trust: We trust that the router is properly secured, and even that it is
the router it claims to be. If we are familiar with the business or
organization we may not give this a second thought, in the same way that
we routinely trust waiters and salespeople not to abuse our credit card
information. Yet it is important to remember that this expression of
trust is implicit in our decision to connect.</p>
<p>On the broader Web, we also need someone to vouch for the fact that the
website we’re connecting to is actually the one we think it is, because
it’s also incredibly easy to make one website look like another. In
fact, even if you type the URL of the website you want to visit directly
into your browser’s url bar, it’s possible to end up at a website that
only <em>looks</em> like the one you intended to visit. This is also how some
Internet censorship is
implemented,<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">35</a></sup> as was seen recently
in <a href="https://twitter.com/evacide/status/446823642614083585" target="_blank">Turkey</a>.</p>
<p>So how can you be sure that the secure connection you establish is to
the website you’re actually looking for? In practice this is made
possible by the fact that https connections don’t just establish secure
communications willy-nilly. Before agreeing to encode your
communications with a website, your browser first asks it for
identification, in the form of a <em>security certificate</em>. These
certificates work something like digital passports for the Web. They are
issued by certificate authorities which generally provide them after
running a kind of background check on the website, making sure that it
is actually owned by the company or individual who claims to run
it.<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">36</a></sup> Before agreeing to establish a
secure connection to a website via <em>https</em>, your browser asks the site
for this “passport,” and then checks with the issuing authority to make
sure it is authentic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This part of the process is known as “authentication.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> If the credentials check out, your browser moves on to the next step
and actually establishes an encrypted connection. Otherwise, it will
throw up a warning, letting you know that something’s not right.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/websecurity004a.jpg" alt="A valid security certificate means your browser will establish a
secure and *trusted* connection.">

secure and <em>trusted</em> connection.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/websecurity004c.jpg" alt="A bad security certificate will cause your browser to throw up a
warning.">
A bad security certificate will cause your browser to throw up a
warning.</p>
<h3 id="what-an-authenticated-encrypted-connection-means-and-what-it-doesn-t">What an Authenticated, Encrypted Connection Means, and What It Doesn’t</h3>
<p>So let’s say that at this point you’ve connected to both a router and a
website securely. Does that mean that no one can see what you’re doing
on the Web? Not quite. Remember that the information you send to and
from that website still has to find its way from your device to the
website and back again. To do this, every node along the route needs
access to some information about your messages in order make sure they
get to where they’re going. This is where our metadata comes back into
play: Every node on the network still needs to know where each message
is coming from and where it’s going. In this sense, your encrypted Web
traffic is something like mail in a <em>very</em> sturdy envelope; anyone can
see where it’s coming from and when, as well as where it’s going. But
only your device and the website you’re communicating with can open the
envelope to see what’s inside. By contrast, if you connect to a website
via <em>http</em>, it’s more like sending your information via hundreds of
postcards; not only can every node that handles it see where it is
coming from and where it is going, the contents of your messages are
there for anyone to read as well.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/websecurity003a.jpg" alt="An *http* connection leaves all the contents of your packets visible
to anyone on the network.">
An <em>http</em> connection leaves all the contents of your packets visible
to anyone on the network.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/websecurity003b.jpg" alt="An *https* connection, meanwhile, protects the contents. Only the
metadata remains visible.">
An <em>https</em> connection, meanwhile, protects the contents. Only the
metadata remains visible.</p>
<p>This is why using <em>https</em> connections is so important, especially when
you are sending sensitive information like usernames and passwords. The
same goes for any website where you might enter financial, medical or
personally identifying information. In spite of this, many websites that
ask for and deal with sensitive information don’t always require or
provide https connections. Until very recently, for example, Yahoo did
not require an <em>https</em> connection to log in to its mail
service.<sup><a href="footnotes/README.html">37</a></sup> Ideally, one would use
https connections as much as possible. Fortunately, however, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation recently launched a project aptly named
<a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPSEverywhere</a>, a free browser
plugin that always attempts to make a secure connection, and then only
revert to an insecure one if the former is unavailable. Installing this
on your browsers can help make using the most secure connection
available a more seamless part of your Web browsing activity.</p>
