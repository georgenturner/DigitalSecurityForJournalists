The Technology: Understanding the Infrastructure of Digital Communications
========================================================================

### Prologue: The Design Imperative of the Internet

The essential framework for the design of the modern Internet was first
described by Paul Baran in a 10-page paper published in March of 1964.
Issued as part of the IEEE’s “Transactions of the Professional Technical
Group on Communications Systems,”<sup>[28](/digital-security-for-journalists/footnotes/README.html)</sup>
the introduction to the paper–entitled, “On Distributed Communications
Networks”–begins with the following sentence:

> “Let us consider the synthesis of a communication network which will
> allow several hundred major communications stations to talk with one
> another after an enemy attack.”

The paper goes on to describe the salient features of such a network,
designed as a direct response to the most terrifying threat of the
then-ongoing Cold War: a large-scale, long-range, distributed attack on
American soil.

Just as George Washington forewent postal mail and employed private
couriers to send messages to his
troops<sup>[29](/digital-security-for-journalists/footnotes/README.html)</sup> during the Revolutionary
War, the U.S. military sought to guarantee the integrity and
availability of its own communications in case of a substantial attack
on commercial networks during the Cold War. Achieving this, however,
required that the system be all of the things that the telephone system
of the day was not: distributed, redundant, asynchronous, relatively
unpredictable, and cheap. Rather than requiring the synchronous,
persistent connections of telephony, which transmitted information
through the hubs and spokes of a decentralized network, the Internet
would function something like an automated, multi-hop telegraph: Digital
messages would be broken into pieces and individually addressed to the
destination on the sender’s end, then collected and reassembled at the
other.

Centralized and decentralized networks fail quickly in the case of
malfunction or destruction.

As anyone who has ever chosen the “ship as items become available”
option knows, there is advantage to breaking up “deliveries” in this
way. Packages (or in the case of the Internet, packets) can be routed
opportunistically, moving toward their destination along whichever
delivery path is most readily available. In addition to maximizing
capacity, this approach also provides a certain level of
unpredictability: Not even the operator of the system, much less an
adversary, can know with complete certainty what the paths of these
packets will be.

![All Internet traffic is broken up into equal-sized
packets.](graphics/websecurity001e.jpg)

Data packets take independent paths across the Internet once they
leave your service provider.

Because the packets are small, there is room for redundancy: The same
packets can be cheaply sent multiple times to ensure delivery. This
means that the cost of losing any given packet is small; if the first
copy doesn’t reach the destination, the second or third will. In the
worst case scenario, the packets’ return address can be used to ask for
any found missing.

![Data packets may be regularly dropped or lost in
transit.](graphics/websecurity001g.jpg)

transit.

another copy.

This request is made possible by the requirement that packets travel
with a “return address.”

At the infrastructure level, this cheap redundancy–especially coupled
with the return-address safety net–ensures that neither the individual
routing nodes nor their actual connections to one another need be
especially reliable. Connections may be intermittent or interrupted;
nodes may malfunction or be destroyed. This means that the stations
themselves can be both cheap and plentiful–and the more plentiful the
nodes, the more resilient the network. Or, as Baran put it, the
distributed network of the Internet is one:

> “…in which system destruction requires the enemy to pay the price of
> destroying *n* of *n* stations. If *n* is made sufficiently large, it
> can be shown that highly survivable system structures can be built,
> even in the thermonuclear era.”<sup>[30](/digital-security-for-journalists/footnotes/README.html)</sup>

In other words: an atomized communications solution for the atomic age.
